# Documentation

Thorough documentation is essential to both software engineering and science. This project uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to generate and host its documentation.

See [Sphinx's Documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html) for instructions on how to set up and use Sphinx.

Sphinx requires a basic fluency in reStructuredText. See [Sphinx's reStructuredText Primer](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) for a brief introduction to manipulating these files.

This repo uses GitHub pages in a slightly hacky manner. See the [following](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3382#issuecomment-409068915) for a more detailed discussion on this method.
