# Insight_Data_Science_example_repo  

This Github repo contains an example of how to structure your repo for your Insight project. You do not have to follow this structure exactly, but it may be useful to clone this repo as a starting point for your own project. Here is an outline of the different files we recommend having in your project repo. Below we go into details of what exactly that directory/file should contain.

## Overview of your Insight projects Github repo:

Name_of_repo
README.md
/Abbreviated_project_name
/develop
/config
/pipelines
/tests
/docs
/data
LICENSE
pipfile
pipefile.lock
.gitignore
.git


## Name_of_repo
When you are starting out your project you likely don't know exactly where the project will take you, so don't worry too much about picking a name right now. You can always change the name of the repo later by clicking 'settings' on github within your repo. When you do get closer to finalizing your project we suggest naming your repo the same as the name of your project within you slide deck to stay consistent.

## README.md
This is arguably the most important file within your github repo! If there is a file titled 'README.md' in the home directory of your repo, it will automatically become the landing page for the the repo. That means if you share your repo with someone they will see the README first and that may be the only file they look at before deciding if they should continue looking. [Here](https://gist.github.com/fvcproductions/1bfc2d4aecb01a834b46) is an example of how to structure your README. Remember the information at the top is the most important and the further down information is the less likely anyone is to read it. Its always better if you can embed images of gifs in your README to illustrate difficult concepts. That makes he README more enticing to actually read. Your README may contain a lot of information. If thats the case we highly recommend adding a table of contents to make it easier to navigate.
